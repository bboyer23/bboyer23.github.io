        <h2>Where It Started</h2>
        <p>
            I initially grew interest in technology through modding video games that I played as a kid.
            No rare candies on Pokemon meant that I had to learn the item ID of rare candies and edit my save file directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I definitely don't see myself as a programmer - but rather someone that was able to get what they wanted by using the resources available to them.
            <strong>stay curious, learn from what interests you, and be willing to adapt.</strong>
        </p>

    <section class="story-section fade-in">
        <h2>Building My Foundation</h2>
        <p>
            During my time at Framingham State University, I have been fortunate to interact with so many knowledgeable professors and peers.
            I was given an opportunity to rebuild my technical foundation from the ground up.
        </p>
        <p>
            I dove into:
        </p>
        <ul class="story-list">
            <li>Computer Science I & II (Java, OOP, fundamentals)</li>
            <li>Operating Systems & UNIX</li>
            <li>Networking Technologies</li>
            <li>Database Management</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing & AI Concepts</li>
            <li>Quantitative & Statistical Analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thanks to the IBM Accelerate program, I was able to gain perspective on how education can be transformed into professional assets.
            Projects at school became more personal as they became something that I could share with others and stand behind.
        </p>

        <h2>Becoming a Builder</h2>
        <p>
            As my confidence grew, so did my ambition.  
            I started building real projects — each one bigger and more complex than the last.
        </p>

    ======================== -->
    <section class="story-section fade-in">
    <h2>Learning in Professional Settings</h2>
    <p>
        I’ve been fortunate to work in roles that challenged me to grow and see how real teams operate:
    </p>
    <ul class="story-list">
        <li>IT Analyst Intern @ TJX — Learned how Agile teams communicate, how work flows across an organization, and how ServiceNow supports large-scale operations</li>
        <li>IBM Accelerate — Gained early exposure to AI solution design and how companies think through client problems</li>
        <li>Cloud Solved MSP — Built foundational experience with Azure environments, security basics, and hybrid systems</li>
        <li>Years at Shaw’s — Learned leadership by supporting people directly and navigating day-to-day challenges</li>
    </ul>
