        <h1 class="page-title">My Story</h1>
        <p class="story-intro">
            My path hasn't been linear, and it hasn't always been clear.  
            But every challenge, every restart, and every mistake taught me something valuable.  
            This is the story of how I learned to keep building — one step at a time.

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 1 — EARLY YEARS
    ======================== -->
    <section class="story-section fade-in">
        <h2>Where It Started</h2>
        <p>
            I grew up learning resilience out of necessity.  
            Losing my mom young taught me that life doesn't wait, and that I needed to figure things out for myself.  
            That mindset — keep learning, keep moving forward — became the foundation for everything after.
        </p>
        <p>
            Music, tech, and curiosity were my anchors.  
            I wasn't coding yet, but I was developing a mindset that would shape everything after:
            <strong>stay curious, learn from what interests you, and be willing to adapt.</strong>
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 2 — NEAR COLLAPSE
    ======================== -->
    <section class="story-section fade-in">
        <h2>The Dip — And the Reset</h2>
        <p>
            COVID hit harder than I expected.  
            I struggled through 2020–2021, lost momentum, and eventually stepped back from school to regroup.
            It felt like failure at the time. In hindsight, it was necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            During that time, I worked to stabilize myself — financially and mentally.  
            No grand plans, just daily progress. Every small step forward mattered.
            That's when I learned that growth isn't always visible, and that's okay.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 3 — RETURNING STRONGER
    ======================== -->
    <section class="story-section fade-in">
        <h2>Building My Foundation</h2>
        <p>
            When I returned to college at Framingham State University, I came back with purpose.  
            I wasn’t just there to pass classes — I was there to build a future I could trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            I dove into:
        </p>
        <ul class="story-list">
            <li>Computer Science I & II (Java, OOP, fundamentals)</li>
            <li>Operating Systems & UNIX</li>
            <li>Networking Technologies</li>
            <li>Database Management</li>
            <li>Cloud Computing & AI Concepts</li>
            <li>Quantitative & Statistical Analysis</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These weren’t just courses. They were bricks — solid, reliable — in the foundation I was rebuilding for myself.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 4 — TRANSFORMATION
    ======================== -->
    <section class="story-section fade-in">
        <h2>Becoming a Builder</h2>
        <p>
            As my confidence grew, so did my ambition.  
            I started building real projects — each one bigger and more complex than the last.
        </p>

        <div class="story-highlights">
            <div class="highlight-card scale-up">
                <h3>ChronoBox</h3>
                <p>A local cloud device built from the ground up — Debian 13, RAID, Nextcloud, hardware design, and security.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight-card scale-up">
                <h3>Smart Return Tracker</h3>
                <p>A Dockerized Express + PostgreSQL full-stack project simulating enterprise retail workflows.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="highlight-card scale-up">
                <h3>FEDC Capstone Lead</h3>
                <p>Led a 6-person team delivering a full Squarespace website to a real economic development organization.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            These projects weren’t homework anymore — they were proof that I could take an idea, build it, and deliver it.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 5 — PROFESSIONAL RISE
    ======================== -->
    <section class="story-section fade-in">
        <h2>Learning in Professional Settings</h2>
        <p>
            I've been fortunate to work in roles that challenged me in different ways:
        </p>
        <ul class="story-list">
            <li>IT Analyst Intern @ TJX — Learning Agile workflows, ServiceNow, and how large teams coordinate</li>
            <li>IBM Accelerate — Exploring AI solutions and understanding how companies approach client problems</li>
            <li>Cloud Solved MSP — Building hands-on experience with Azure, security practices, and hybrid systems</li>
            <li>Years at Shaw's — Developing leadership skills by supporting people and managing operations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each role showed me a different perspective — how teams work, how systems fail, how communication matters.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- =======================
         SECTION 6 — TODAY AND BEYOND
    ======================== -->
    <section class="story-section fade-in story-ending">
        <h2>Where I’m Heading</h2>
        <p>
            My journey taught me three things:
        </p>

        <ul class="story-list">
            <li><strong>You don’t need a perfect start, only a direction.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>You grow by breaking things, fixing them, and not being afraid of the process.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Forward is the only direction that matters.</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I’m on track to graduate in December 2025 — and I’m building myself into someone capable of creating systems,
            leading teams, and tackling any challenge, no matter how complex.
        </p>

        <p class="closing-line">
            This is where I’ve been.  
            But more importantly — it’s the foundation for everything I’m building next.
