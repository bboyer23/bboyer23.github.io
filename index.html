            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome to My Portfolio! Hello, I'm Benjamin Boyer (or just Ben), a dedicated and passionate student at Framingham State, pursuing a major in Business Information Technology with a minor in Computer Science. Currently balancing my academic journey, I also wear multiple hats outside the classroom. On weekends, I lead as a manager at a local grocery store, overseeing operations and ensuring a seamless customer experience. Simultaneously, I serve as a Remote Network Technician for a Microsoft MSP, delving into the realm of IT support and troubleshooting. My love for technology extends beyond the confines of work and academics. I find joy in coding during my spare time, constantly exploring new technologies and enhancing my skills. I firmly believe in the power of technology to transform lives and create meaningful solutions. Away from the screen, I cherish moments with my loved ones and indulge in my passion for music. I find solace in helping others, and it's this drive that fuels my aspirations. Looking ahead, I aim to carve a path into the dynamic fields of DevOps and cybersecurity, combining my technical skills with a passion for securing digital landscapes. Let's connect and explore the boundless possibilities that technology brings!</p>
